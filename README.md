# EDA Shoes StockX
The main idea of this project is making a EDA to participate en the data contest of the shop Stockx

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python,Streamlit, Libraries of choice

The first step when I approach this dataset, was seeing how the data is distributed and cleaning or chaning any variable. 
After this, I printed how the two main  brands of dataset are differente between them. 
Following the basics step, the next one I made was creating graphics that answer the questions I asked my self: 
        - How many shoes of each brand are for sale
        - The differencial price of each model and how much they sell for.
        - Two maps representing how the selling bussiness represent in all of USA. 
        - More...


## Lessons Learned:
This is the first step into the Data-Analysis World. I learned the principals of how to approach a data problem and the usage of the main libraries to work with data. At first, the main problem I encounterd was how to deal with analysis of the dataset and how to writed in a way it would be readable,i think i achieved. 

However my favourite part was seeing how all the variables related each other, priting all the graphics and maps. In other words, seeing how numbers can be transformed into graphics values that are easir to understand. 

The main lesson i learned from this project is how to approach an EDA. Obviously, I have so mucho to learn and I will improving this work as soon as I learn new things.
